#TIME - mesa has a scheduler
#
# The scheduler is a special model component which controls the order in which agents are activated.
# For example, all the agents may activate in the same order every step; their order might be shuffled;
# we may try to simulate all the agents acting at the same time; and more.
# Mesa offers a few different built-in scheduler classes, with a common interface.
# That makes it easy to change the activation regime a given model uses, and see whether it changes the model behavior.
# This may not seem important, but scheduling patterns can have an impact on your results [Comer2014]_.
